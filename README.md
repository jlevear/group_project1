###Project Proposal

Our project aims to discover correlations between the global happiness ranking of individual countries and if relationships between their happiness ranking of their region can be found. We'll investigate the changes of these rankings over each of the last five years based on their score subsets (economy, family, health, freedom and trust in government). Finally, we'll look at the influence of a country's ecological footprint and examine whether that provides any patterns regarding their happiness ranking and any other related questions that the datasets suggest.
